# TODO

- Fix method! See example\uniform for results
- Check test folder cases
- Check `naive_entropies` in an example plot

- Study the variance of the naive entropy estimator in examples to check empirically that the relationship is quadratic and not linear with respect to 1/n. 
- Test `DirectEstimator`, introduced in doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.197
